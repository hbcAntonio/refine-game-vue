# About
To anyone viewing this repository, I hope you find this project fun, because that's exactly what I had when coding it.
#### Why all of the `clif` prefixes and the snake_case?
- It's an homage to old Ragnarok server emulators (Cronus, eAthena) and their C source code.
- `clif` stood for `client info` and was used for client-facing functions in the server.
- As a 12-year-old kid learning to program, I thought that was the coolest thing ever.
## What this project is
- My learning experience in Vue 3.
- Something I had fun with and coded *mindlessly*.
- An homage to the feature I hate the most in Ragnarok Online.
- The only repo I have the rights to show publicly.
## What this project is _NOT_
- Deeply thought out.
- Optimized.
- A good example of SCSS.
- My area of expertise (front-end).
